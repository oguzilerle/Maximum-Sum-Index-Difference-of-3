# Maximum-Sum-Index-Difference-of-3
Given an array of positive numbers, algorithms find the maximum sum of a subsequence of the array with the constraint that any two numbers in the subsequence should have at least an index difference of 3 in the array (e.g. in a={'0','1','2','3','4'}, index difference of '4' and '1' is 3).
